I rescued Valis and broke him out of prison after Kiv kicked opened his iron prison cell. 
House Sham is looking for someone powerful enough and not tied to the city Nebune. After we got
out of the city we meet up with a man named jaren. The goal was to bring Valis to a man named
portule. His overall goal is to over throw the government of Nebune.
