If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps <span class=\"No-Break\">you put it on).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart &mdash; in a chaste sort of devotion.

These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo.

A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds&mdash;responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family’s care, or even to the title itself.
