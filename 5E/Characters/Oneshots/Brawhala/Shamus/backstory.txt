When I was younger I visited my uncle house. I found him dead and my aunt was sent to prison for the murder. 
Since that first encounter with death I have always had a facination with what happens after we die. 
After the murder of my uncle my family decided to leave the wilds and move into the city where they thought
would help me ajust. When I got to the city my interest with the after life though made me an outcast with
all the other kids. My social skills are rather lacking because of this fact but my love for death has only
grown. 

I found my self facing 37 counts of murder because I was found at the newest site of a serial killers latest
kill. I have never killed anything or anyone before. But because of my social anxiety I didnt stand up for 
myself in court plus the cops were very happy to put away the aclaimed serial killer.
