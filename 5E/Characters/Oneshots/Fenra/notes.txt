Fenra was around before the destruction of the gods. As a holy soul he was sent to the material plane and given a blessing by the gods to protect the mortal beings. Since he was on the material plane fulling his duty he was saved from the mass murder of the celestials. With his holy connection severed the holy blessing placed within him has slowly started to wane with each use of his radiant soul. It becomes only a matter of time before there is no blessing left. With nothing but death and destruction left in the celestial realm Fenra has made a promise to himself and any higher beings left to do his best to protect and shelter what little light is left in the world.

His blessing takes form in the shape of a golden shash wrapping around his body from his shoulder to his hip. With the gods dead and gone there is nothing left to replenish this blessing so it is slowly starting to fade to black/dull gray. Once all of the blessing has faded it will appear as if there is a massive scared from his shoulder to his waist. Whose to say what will become of Fenra once the blessing has fully disappeared. Maybe something else will power that blessing or maybe he will just die.
