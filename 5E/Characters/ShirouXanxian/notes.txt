PARTY MEMBERS:
Shirou Xanxier-me:
Shirou has a good heart. In everything he does he means well. Spying for the org means doing something looked down 
upon but in the long run it will save more people. He is hesitant to kill but does not mind a fight My backstory 
that Iâ€™m going with is my town was destroy in some magic accident. My adpoted father rescued me from the fire. 
He was a splendid mage who worked for ark. Sadly he passed before i was properly trained. I grew up closely tied to 
the organization and that were i learned my bow skills and my craftiness with sneaking around. Some where along the 
way ipun decided to choose me for some reason and awoken the magic that was in me. Since then i was on yalls team 
running around assisting ark
