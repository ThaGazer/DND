:WORLD of GALIFAR NOTES:

The Five Nations:
  In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire.
  The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a
  unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations;
  the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences,
  an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.
  A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their
  neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five
  Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold.
  The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.

The Treaty of Thronehold:
  Officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign
  states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q’barra,
  the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain
  diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared
  itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.
  
  -liberated the Warforged, but also banned Cannith from creating any more
  -New peace treaty has been signed and Cyre has been added as a new Nation.

Thronehold: Middle of the major nations. Place of the peace talks and where the King of the Contient.

Silver Flame:
  Its a little weird to have such an active god in the world. Most other gods are reserved from interacting with the 
  material world
  
Emerald Claw: Minara Vol, matriarch of House Vol sought to end the war between elves and dragons by fusing the 
  blood of both races. She was impregnated by the Emerald Claw whom, she fell in love with during her pregnancy.
  Minara gave birth to a girl whom she named Erandis. Last heir of the dragon Mark of death. Emerald Claw himself,
  whom was desperate for an end to the conflicts between the two races, voluntarily announced the news of the 
  union of elvish and dragon blood. Fighting ceased as the dragons and elves united under the common goal of 
  exterminating House Vol's bloodline and all half-dragons. The Emerald Claw is believed to have vanished soon 
  after the purge began. Some historians believe him to have been killed defending the half-dragons
  
The Knights Arcane: are a specialized military group of Aundair headed by Lord Darro ir'Lain and loyal to the crown.
  They are one of Aundair's strongest and most capable units. Seized major treasures during the Last War and this is 
  Lord Darro's main source of wealth.
  
Phatom Phoenix: Ship that the TC commandeered and is currently using

Dreadhold: Dreadhold was created on the orders of Karrn the Conqueror of Karrnath for his own evil purposes. The first
  kings of Galifar had it converted into an almost inescapable prison. The dwarfs of House Kundarak currently run and
  maintain the prison.
    - A master thief is rumored to be held here holding a Key that can open anything.

Some say the moons are portals. No one has ever landed on a moon to know for sure

Dolurrh- The realm of dreams
People: Quori - creatures that interact can enter others dreams. (Dream eaters is my guess)

  A war broke out with the giants of Xen 'Drik. With magic they learned to harness from the dragons they shattered the
  moon tied to it and severed the connection to the material plane.

  -The realm used to teleport the ship passes through the 13th separated moon?

Xoriat- The realm of maddness

  -Part of the sealing when Rittenhaus first joined

=======================================================================================================================
Rittenhuas' Magic Trick:
  -pick any number you like 1-infinity                    ex. 683245
  -add the sum of every digit to form a new number            => 28
  -subtract that number from the original number              => 683217
  -sum the digits of the new number                           => 27
  -sum the digits again until there is only one number left   => 9
  -divide by two                                              => 4.5 final answer

The Walsbach Tower (Home of the twilight council and the start of the Wizardry School of Neodymium):
As the party approaches the tower they walk over rolling hills covered in velvet grasses. The clouds hang low here as
if trying to touch the ground, giving the area a slight fog on days. Not so much eerie as the stillness breaths of
serenity. There is a forest perimeter in the distance filled with tall trees. Whose tops reach ever higher in to the
sky trying as they might to pierce the fog. The trees canopies are covered in cotton ball like leaves attached to
beanpole trunks. Ancient Sequoia trees that stand as a monument to the test of time. As the party crest the last hill
before them lays a flat valley with grass stalks swaying in the wind. Further ahead from where Rittenhaus has lead
the party, there is a alcove in the tree cover and tucked into that alcove stands a tower whose top ascends higher than
even the trees. A magnificent tower that stands proudly at exactly 144.25ft tall. Thick stone walls formed into the
shape of a decahedron. Decorating the tower every 12ft up the wall is a band of pink hue glass backlit in darkness.
In the fog that hangs over the tower, the glass seems to be immolating itself turning from shades of pink to red.
Reminds several of descriptions of the astral sea. On the ground around the tower there are beads of metal strewn
about. At first glance they seem to be haphazardly place. Like if a giant dropped a bag of marbles. But upon further
inspection you notice there are 6 circular path ways set around the tower. Each path intersecting with a ball to form
the likes of a pearl necklace.

Permanent Invisible servant named: Coylyn

Tower Levels:
1-3: As you enter the first thing you notice are how thick the walls are, a good 3 meters thick
    (1meter - 3.2ft, Great Wall of China is roughly 5 meters thick). 2 layers of stone sandwiched around a section of
    dried mud. The first three levels are a open grand hall 30ft high. On the ground are three metal disk 10ft across
    spaced out from each other. Each has different sets of seating arrangements.
	Along the sides of the tower from top to bottom are two sets of stone slats rising toward the top forming a set of
	stairs to the next floors. There is a chandeller suppened in the middle of the hall slowly spinning. Nested inside
    of the chandeller are smaller geometric metal shapes connected at weird points that dont seem physically possible 
    slowly spinning as well.
4: Is a generic assembly hall. Like the senator hall in star wars for the Republic. On the outside of the hall is a
    walk way for people to access stairs to the next floors. 
5: Is a dining hall in the fashion of a Beer-garden. Long benches stretch the length of the hall. In the middle of a 
    long wall is a window into a serving center. Serving tables, heat lamps and anything that is used to serve food
    is nicely tucked in this room. There is a rectangular opening in the ceiling in the middle of the serving room 
    that leads up into the kitchen but there are no stairs going up just a hole in the floor of the kitchen.
    The stairs that run along the sides of the towers continue on up.
6: Is a kitchen. As you crest the floor there is a wall that runs the length of this floor blocking entrance to the
    kitchen. In the middle of the wall there is a set of double doors if you wish to enter. There are no chefs(yet) 
    but there are pots and pans flying around and food is being cook.
7-8: Are open to the outside world. The upper half is seemly disconnected from the lower half. This level is a garden.
    Not many plants yet. Awaiting a druids touch.
    There is a permanent major image going around the outside so if you were looking at the tower from the outside it
    would still look like continuous stone. There are 4 massively "tall" trees spread equally through the floor. 
    On Closer inspection they are metal beams instead supporting and securing the upper floors to the lower.
9: Bedrooms
10: free for the party to take over and make their own
11: Library. Growing book collection. Most selfs are still empty though. There is a desk in the middle of the room with
    arcane symbols scribbled all over it. A person sitting at this table has the ability to read any language from
    a book that is placed on the table.

12-14: These floors feel more secluded compared to the other floors. To access this group of floors one must enter on 
    the 13 floor and walk either up or down to get to the other floors. There is not landing on the 13th floor to 
    indicate where an entery way would be. A false wall hides an entery point that takes a 19dc investigastion check to 
    find if someone is searching around the 13th floor. Not everything on this floor is as it seems.
    
    12: Storage for now. Eventually maybe a secure item vault.
    13: Another set of bed rooms but there are only 6 rooms. One for each member of the council. This is the only other
        level with windows besides 7-8. The windows are disguied to look like they dont exist.
    14: is in the proccess of being turned in to a full arcane labatory. Has the only access to the roof.
