:WORLD NOTES:
The Five Nations:
  In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire.
  The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a
  unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations;
  the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences,
  an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.
  A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their
  neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five
  Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold.
  The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.

The Treaty of Thronehold:
  Officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign
  states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q’barra,
  the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain
  diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared
  itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.

Thronehold: Middle of the major nations. Place of the peace talks.

:MOONS:

Some say the moons are portals. No one has ever landed on a moon to know for sure

Dal Quor- The realm of dreams
People: Quori - creatures that interact can enter others dreams. (Dream eaters is my guess)
  They can also possess people through their dreams. That is how they manipulate the material world.
  A war broke out with the giants of Xen 'Drik. With magic they learned to harness from the dragons they shattered the
  moon tied to it and severed the connection to the material plane.

The realm used to teleport the ship passes through the 13th separated moon?

Xoriat- The realm of maddness
Part of the sealing when Rittenhaus first joined

=======================================================================================================================

The Walsbach Tower (Home of the twilight council and the start of the Wizardry School of Neodymium):
As the party approaches the tower they walk over rolling hills covered in velvet grasses. The clouds hang low here as
if trying to touch the ground, giving the area a slight fog on days. Not so much eerie as the stillness breaths of
serenity. There is a forest perimeter in the distance filled with tall trees. Whose tops reach ever higher in to the
sky trying as they might to pierce the fog. The trees canopies are covered in cotton ball like leaves attached to
beanpole trunks. Ancient Sequoia trees that stand as a monument to the test of time. As the party crest the last hill
before them lays a flat valley with grass stalks swaying in the wind. Further ahead from where Rittenhaus has lead
the party, there is a alcove in the tree cover and tucked into that alcove stands a tower whose top ascends higher than
even the trees. A magnificent tower that stands proudly at exactly 144.25ft tall. Thick stone walls formed into the
shape of a decahedron. Decorating the tower every 12ft up the wall is a band of pink hue glass backlit in darkness.
In the fog that hangs over the tower, the glass seems to be immolating itself turning from shades of pink to red.
Reminds several of descriptions of the astral sea. On the ground around the tower there are beads of metal strewn
about. At first glance they seem to be haphazardly place. Like if a giant dropped a bag of marbles. But upon further
inspection you notice there are 6 circular path ways set around the tower. Each path intersecting with a ball to form
the likes of a pearl necklace.

Permanent Invisible servant named: Coylyn

Tower Levels:
1-3: As you enter the first thing you notice are how thick the walls are, a good 3 meters thick
     (1meter - 3.2ft, Great Wall of China is roughly 5 meters thick). 2 layers of stone sandwiched around a section of
   dried mud. The first three levels are a open grand hall 30ft high. On the ground are three metal disk 10ft across
   spaced out from each other. Each has different sets of seating arrangements.

********FOR LATER CONTRUCTION************
If you look up there are three 10ft across metal disk floating spaced out from each other around in the hall.
They each seem to be lazily drifting from side to side. You see one about the crash into the wall but then it stops
mere feet from the wall and is repealed in a different direction controlled by forces you don't understand. Straight
ahead of the party near the middle of the room is a stand. Placed a top of the stand is a crystal ball. Softly rotating
in its stand.
  Platform controls:
    Up - twist right
    Down - twist left
    Left - roll left
    Right - roll right
    Away - roll up
    Toward - roll down
*********************************************

Along the sides of the tower from top to bottom are two sets of stone slats rising toward the top forming a set of
stairs to the next floors.
4: Is a generic assembly hall. Like the senator hall in star wars for the Republic. On the outside of the hall is a
  walk way for people to access stairs to the next floors. There are no chefs(yet) but there are pots and pans flying
  around and food is being cook.
5: Is a dining hall in the fashion of a Beer-garden. Long benches stretch the length of the hall. In the middle is a
  window into the serving center. In the back of the center are stairs for the servers to reach the kitchen. The stairs
  that run along the sides of the towers continue on up.
6: is a kitchen. As you crest the floor there is a wall that runs the length of this floor blocking entrance to the
  kitchen. In the middle of the wall there is a set of double doors if you wish to enter.
7-8: Are open to the outside world. The upper half is seemly disconnected from the lower half. This level is a garden.
     There is a permanent major image going around the outside to make it appear continuous stone. There are 4
   massively tall trees spread equally through the floor. On Closer inspection they are metal beams instead
   supporting and securing the upper floors to the lower.
9: Bedrooms
10: free for the party to take over and make their own
11: Library. No books just empty shelfs waiting to hold something. There is a desk in the middle of the room with
    arcane symbols scribbled all over it. A person sitting at this table has the ability to read any language from
  a book that is placed on the table.
12-14: are sealed in stone walls 6ft thick on each side. There are no door in.
