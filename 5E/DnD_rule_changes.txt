:ABILITES:

  - Strength stat determines damage modifiers by melee attacks. Modifiers
    cannot be negitive.

  - Dexterity determines the hit DC for all weapon attacks. Ranged attacks no 
    longer have damage modifiers. Dex cannot be used for damage modifiers
  
  - Constitution determines the total health of a character. This health is
    split between the 4 body part groups of the characters. Legs, torso, 
    arms, head. 5 for winged creatures? Each body part has a total hp pool. 
    Players can assign hit points on level up equal to hp rolled to any part 
    they please raising the total hit point pool for that part. If the head or 
    torso fall to 0 hit points the character is unconscious and making death 
    saving throws. Each part below (1/4 or 1/2?) hp is considered ingured and 
    imposes a sort of disadvange. AOE damage is shared across the body parts 
    rounded up. If caught in a fireball that deals 24 damage. 
    24 / 4 = 6 => each body part takes 6 damage. 
    Armor changes are probably incoming too.
    
  - intelligence atays the same
  
  - Wisdom stays the same
  
  - Charisma stays the same.
  
:WEAPONS:

  - unarmed strikes above 10 strength deal 1d4 + strength mod.
  - all crossbows deal an extra dice of damage. So a light crossbow deals 2d8
    instead of 1d8
  - Net removed the bullshit solo attack rule. Or this could be a half feat?
  
:HEALS:

  - single target healing spells like healing word or cure wounds target a
    single body part. Cure wounds will remove the negative affect of a body 
    part for being ingured regardless if the body part is above the ingured 
    hp thresh hold.
    
:ARMOR:

 - armors cover certain body parts. Uncovered body parts have a base ac of 10
