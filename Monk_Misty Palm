Class: Monk
SubClass: The Way of the Misty Palm
	Monks of the Misty Palm are masters of deception on the battle field. 
	They learn techniques thats allow them to leave shadows of themselves 
	across the battlefield as they move. As they progress in the technique 
	they can move through the mist of their shadows at what appears insane
	speeds and even control the mist.

Honed Punches: 
	Starting when you take this tradition at level 3 you gain expertise in
	unarmed attacks. Double you martial die when making unarmed attacks. (Might be busted)

Misty Palm Technique:
	Starting when you take this tradition at level 3 you can manipulate you ki
	to create a misty clone of yourself within half of your movement speed. 
	You spend 1 ki point per clone you create to produce an	illusion of 
	yourself as a bonus action.
		-ac boost next to clone?
		-spend a ki point to shift to a clone as a reaction
			-shifting still can invoke opportunity attacks 
				if you move past a creature
			=if hit shifting stops immeditily.
		-clones can attack when you take the attack action at quater damage 
			rounded down(min 1)? until higher levels?
		
		OR
		
		-mimic Mirror image spell cost 2 ki. higher monk levels more clones
		
Shifting Mist:
	Starting at lvl 6 you can shift around the battle field. You can spend 
	one ki point per shift to trade places with a clone. If you shift behind a 
	creature you auto crit on hit. You can move your clones using an amount of
	your movement speed that the clone moves. Creatures cannot tell the 
	difference between you and your clones.
